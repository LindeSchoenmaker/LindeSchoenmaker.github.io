# Step 1: inputs

## Exercise 1

For this exercise you wil be using the thyroid hormone alpha model. Tip: for more detail on the models, use the QMRF document

Q 1.1 What property does this model predict and how is this value derived?

Q 1.2 What is the performance of this model on an external validation set?

## Exercise 2

Next you want to enter the following molecules; Liothyronine and Thyroid Hormone Receptor Antagonist, 1-850

Q 2 What are the SMILES of these molecules (tip use PubChem for looking up the molecules)?

Enter the molecules and click run, go to the next exercises about result interpretation
