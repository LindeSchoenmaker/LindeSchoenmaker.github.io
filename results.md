# Step 2: Results

## Exercise 3

To answer the following question you will be analyzing the results you generated in step 1

Q 3.1 What is the predicted bioactivity value of .. for thyroid hormone receptor alpha?

Q 3.2.1 How similar is // to the most similar molecule (nearest neighbor) from the model's training set?

Q 3.2.2 How is the similarity calculated, which properties is it based on (hit: have a look at the QPRF document)

Q 3.2.3 Where does the experimental value from the nearest neighbor originate from? What experiment was done?

Q 3.3.1 Do the molecules fall within the applicability domain (AD) of the model?

Q 3.3.2 How is this calculated, which properties is it based on (hit: have a look at the QPRF document)

## Exercise 4

Modify the ... 

Q 4.1 What happens to the predicted bioactivity value?

Q 4.2 Is this prediction withing the applicability domain of the model?
