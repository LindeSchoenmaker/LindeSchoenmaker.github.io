# QSPRpred workshop

(In a separate window) open [qsprpred.cloud.vhp4safety.nl](https://qsprpred.cloud.vhp4safety.nl/).

Welcome to the Workshop on how to use (pre-existing) QSAR models for making predictions on molecular initiating event (MIE) activation! This markdown provides materials to help you explore the options that our tool offers and how to interpret the results. 

## Workshop overview

The QSPRpred web page serves as an interface for users to interact with QSAR models that have been developed for various MIEs. These models predict the activity of chemicals, based on learned patterns. This workshop is designed to help you predict the effect of specific chemicals and to interpret results that are returned. 

(optional) The end of this markdown also includes an example of how this type of models are trained.

## Step 1: inputs

This section focuses on how to select inputs, namely;

* selecting an endpoint and model
* entering your molecule(s) of interest

## Step 2: results

This section walks through the result interpretation and covers the following aspects;

* bioactivity prediction
* accuracy and certainty of the prediction

## Optional: train your own QSAR model

In this section you will see the basic steps needed to train a QSAR model using the open-source package QSPRpred. It requires basic understanding of python.
