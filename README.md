# QSPRpred workshop

Go to [qsprpred.cloud.vhp4safety.nl](https://qsprpred.cloud.vhp4safety.nl/).

Welcome to the Workshop on how to use (pre-existing) QSAR models for making predictions on molecular initiating event (MIE) activation! This markdown provides materials to help you explore the options that are offered and interpret the results. 

## Workshop overview

The QSPRpred web page serves as an interface for users to interact with QSAR models that have been developed for various MIEs. These models predict the activity of chemicals, based on learned patterns. This workshop is designed to help you query specific predictions and interpret results that are returned. 

(optional) The end of this markdown includes an example of how these type of models are trained, to help you learn how to train your own.
